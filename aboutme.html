        <p class="center">Hello! I'm KingPotatoTato, or Tato for short. I made this website just to show some of my interests and get better at HTML & CSS. I would like to thank my Business Software teacher who, helps me learn more about HTML & CSS. The reason I don't give my name out is that I like digital privacy (or, much you can get, now-a-days) so I don't have that many socials (except for the ones you can find on the <a href="contact.html">Contact Page</a>) but otherwise I try to stay anonymous on the internet. I am sure you can find my name floating out there somewhere, but I try and hide it for the most part, because nowadays your data is the most valuable thing.<br>
        Now, you may be wondering. Why is my online name KingPotatoTato/Tato? Well, back in 4th grade, my teacher did this thing called "Free Write Fridays" where all you had to do is write a story and then, the teacher would pick 3-5 people to read their story. At first I would write all kinds of stories: long ones, short ones, funny ones, cringey ones, and the likes. But one day I wrote a story that my teacher and classmates really liked: a potato rising to power in a garden through war and bloodshed. This sparked a series of stories about a Potato being the king of some unknown garden and not wanting to be taken by pot humans to the kitchen. After around 3 months of writing this, it was the end of the year and it was time to clean out our desks, and sadly, I threw all of the stories away. Now I didn't have the stories physically, but I did have them in my mind and my friends still remembered them and so it became a sort of inside joke until I wanted a Discord account and wanted a good username for it. So I remembered that some of my friends called me King Potato, so I tried that "KingPotato". This username is taken. So I thought, how about King, Potato, Tato? It wasn't taken. So soon, every time I sign up for something online, I use the alias KingPotatoTato, or Tato for short.</p>
